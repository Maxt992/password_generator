## Project Description
​
Using Javascript, I attempted to create a working password generator that stored user input to provide a unique password with user chosen characters and a password length between 8 and 128. I ran into many roadblocks, and wound up stuck towards the end of the project. I hope to go over my work with a TA in order to get the app working. 
​
## Usage
​
To generate a password with user chosen length and charset.
